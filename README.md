Data Analytics Projects
Welcome to my Data Analytics Projects repository. This portfolio demonstrates my hands-on experience with real-world datasets using Python, Power BI, and Microsoft Excel. These projects span various domains such as retail, education, logistics, customer behavior, and electric vehicles. Each project is structured to showcase the end-to-end data analytics process, from data collection and cleaning to in-depth analysis and compelling data visualizations.

Whether you are a recruiter assessing practical skills, a student looking for inspiration, or a professional exploring data storytelling, this repository offers well-documented examples of how data can be transformed into meaningful insights.

Repository Contents
Jupyter Notebook Projects (Python)
1. Diwali Sales Analysis
Analyzed sales data collected during the Diwali season to identify customer behavior and preferences. Key aspects include age-wise and gender-wise spending, city-level sales performance, and popular product categories. Techniques such as data cleaning, group-by operations, and visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn were applied.

2. Customer Churn Prediction
Exploratory data analysis of customer churn data. This project identifies potential causes of churn and segments customers based on risk. The goal is to assist businesses in designing better retention strategies. Includes preprocessing steps, univariate and bivariate analysis, and customer segmentation.

Power BI Projects
1. Chocolate Sales Data Modeling
Created a complete Power BI report for chocolate sales using a relational model. Implemented DAX measures, filters, and slicers to offer insights such as sales by region, product performance, and monthly trends. Focused on KPIs and business decision support.

2. EV Data Visuals
Visual report on electric vehicle (EV) data to assess trends in adoption across different regions and demographics. Highlights include growth rates, comparisons between traditional and electric vehicles, and manufacturer analysis.

3. Power BI Visualization Report
An interactive report combining different visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and filters to present a clean and insightful dashboard. Demonstrates mastery in using Power BIâ€™s user interface and features.

4. Data Modeling with Power BI
Focused on developing clean and structured data models using relationships between tables, DAX functions, and calculated columns to support scalable dashboard development.

5. New Visualization Report
This project includes a unique set of experimental layouts and design approaches to improve storytelling through dashboards. Explores creative usage of visuals, layout arrangement, and user interaction techniques.

Excel Projects
1. Student Performance Dataset
Cleaned and analyzed a dataset containing student scores across subjects. Explored relationships between variables such as study hours, parental background, and academic success. Used pivot tables and charts for data visualization.

2. VLOOKUP Practice
A demonstration of Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and conditional formatting to retrieve and highlight specific data. This serves as a fundamental practice in Excel-based data manipulation.

3. International Logistics Dataset
Worked with logistics and membership data to analyze regional growth, cost efficiency, and global distribution patterns. Used Excel functions and formatting tools to derive key performance indicators.
